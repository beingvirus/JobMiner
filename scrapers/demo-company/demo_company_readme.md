# Demo Scraper

This is a **demo scraper** for JobMiner.  
It scrapes a **local static HTML file** (`demo_jobs.html`) instead of a real website.  

## Why?
- No risk of external site changes breaking the scraper
- Demonstrates the scraping logic using BeautifulSoup
- Easy for contributors to test structure and workflow

## Usage
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python demo_company.py
```
